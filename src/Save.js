Software testing is an essential part of the
 software development life cycle (SDLC).
 Playing a significant role in defining 
 the success rate of a particular product,
  owing to the same reason the software
   testing team plays a crucial role even
    after the products development is completed
Therefore, it is important to ensure that
 this software testing team includes a 
 perfect mix of talented as well as 
 capable professionals who are also domain experts.
Being experts in the problem domain make
 it easier for them to create such test scripts
  that make it easier to identify the problem in the product.</p>

          React is a declarative, efficient,
           and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
           It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated
            pieces of code called “components”.

  Python is a high-level, general-purpose
   programming language. Its design 
   philosophy emphasizes code readability
    with the use of significant indentation.[33]

Python is dynamically-typed and 
garbage-collected. It supports 
multiple programming paradigms, 
including structured (particularly procedural),
 object-oriented and functional programming.
  It is often described as a "batteries included"
   language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]


 such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, 
 reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, 
 was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier 
 versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[37]

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
